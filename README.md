# practiceLanding

Practicing styling a landing page for The Odin Project: Fundamentals course.

I added shrinking functionality, which is beyond the scope of the project as described in the curriculum. This taught me a ton of practical things about making shrinking happen and keeping things aesthetically pleasing.

I'm really glad I pushed through the moments of thinking it was good enough and got the site to a place where I was satisfied.
(particularly the case in the "carousel" section(I know it's not really a carousel).)

I also learned about vw units, which pair quite well with flexbox and weren't covered yet in the curriculum, either.
